                <p id="text">Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice. Azurill’s tail is large and
                    bouncy. It is packed full of the nutrients this Pokémon needs to grow. Azurill can be seen bouncing
                    and playing on its big, rubbery tail. Girafarig’s rear head contains a tiny brain that is too small
                    for thinking. However, the rear head doesn’t need to sleep, so it can keep watch over its
                    surroundings 24 hours a day.</p>
